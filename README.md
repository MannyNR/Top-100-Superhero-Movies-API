# Welcome to my IMBD's Top 100 Superhero Movies API

## The Basics

================

A JSON API following the CRUD standard, (Create Read Update Delete). Technologies used for this API were Node, MongoDB, Mongoose and Express. The API provides the [Top 100 Superhero movies according to IMDB user: dmap-161-475937](https://www.imdb.com/list/ls008583762/) (updated as of March 30, 2022).

I'm looking to launch on Heroku soon with more functionality, stay tuned!
